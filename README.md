Computer Vision and Machine Learning for Steel Sheet Quality Inspection

This project advances steel defect inspection methods through a modern computer vision approach. 
We apply a segmentation technique to partition images of steel sheets into various regions, 
enabling a more effective analysis of defects. A new machine learning model is designed to process the pixels from these regions, 
allowing for the detection and classification of defects from a single sample image.
To address this challenge, we utilize U-Net for segmentation and MobileNetV2 for classification, 
leveraging their strengths in handling complex image data efficiently. The performance of these models is evaluated using the Dice Coefficient method, 
which measures the accuracy of the detected defect regions against the ground truth. 
This innovative approach aims to enhance the precision and reliability of quality inspections 
in the steel industry, ultimately contributing to improved product quality and reduced waste.
